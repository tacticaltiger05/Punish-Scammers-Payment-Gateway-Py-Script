# Python Script for Credit Card Entry

![scammer](https://www.mypokecard.com/en/Gallery/my/galery/NzMQVeh1LHUd.jpg)
Payment Gateway services charge 5 cents everytime a credit card payment declines

I'm using dummy, valid credit card info to continuously submit requests for credit card declines

Punish these scammers
